                        <p>No, AsthmaSense is not a medical device and does not replace professional medical advice or treatment. It is an informational tool designed to help you track and understand patterns in your health data. Always consult your doctor for medical decisions.</p>

                        <h3>Do I need a specific type of smartwatch?</h3>
                        <p>We're initially focusing on Apple Watch and Garmin devices, as they provide comprehensive health data. However, we're exploring compatibility with other smartwatch brands. If you have a different device, let us know in the beta signup form!</p>

                        <h3>Will my data be private?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, privacy is a top priority. Your health data stays on your device and is only processed locally or with your explicit consent. We follow strict data protection practices and will never sell your personal information.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>When will the app be available?</h3>
                        <p>We're currently in early development and building our beta version. If you join the early access list, we'll notify you as soon as we're ready to onboard beta testers. We expect to begin beta testing in the coming months.</p>

                        <h3>Does this replace my inhaler or treatment?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely not. AsthmaSense is a monitoring and prediction tool, not a treatment. You should continue following your doctor's prescribed treatment plan, including using your inhaler and medications as directed.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How accurate are the predictions?</h3>
                        <p>Our AI model learns from your personal data over time, so accuracy improves as you use the app. Early predictions are based on general patterns, but the system becomes more personalized to you as it learns your specific triggers and patterns.</p>
